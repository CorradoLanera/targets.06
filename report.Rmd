# Report
The following is our first model for relation between penguins body mass and their culmen depth

```{r}
tar_read(mod_depth) |> 
  summary()
```

Such a simple model show a negative relation that could be misleading, as we can see adding the species as additional confounder.

```{r, width="100%"}
tar_read(mod_depth_spec) |> 
  summary()
```

As always, a picture is worth a thousand words!
```{r}
tar_read(gg)
```
